# Particles

I wanted to learn more about particles, since they look very hard and fuzzy to undestand.  
In the end everything was pretty simple, and the most challenging part was to remember about physics and a little of stochastic methods.  
Thanks a lot to [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming-natural-simulations/programming-particle-systems/a/intro-to-particle-systems) and [Allen Martin](https://web.cs.wpi.edu/~matt/courses/cs563/talks/psys.html) for showing more about this subject and how to implement it.  
I also adapt mostly of the code in Khan Academy to pure JS and using canvas to render the result.

I'm still working on it, but I wanted to show the result right away, so don't mind some confusing files and empty folders yet.
